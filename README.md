OS-independent key remapper and other useful tools for the HORI Tactical Assault Commander F14 Black (Hori Tac14) game keypad.

## Introduction

HORI has released a remapper for the HORI Tactical Assault Commander F14 Black (... or just hori-tac14) [through](https://hori.co.uk/hpc-047u/) entirely [too](https://stores.horiusa.com/HPC-047U/app) many [links](https://store-kmne79kvbv.mybigcommerce.com/content/FF14%20Keypad%20Install%201.17.zip).

It requires the user to install the Visual C++ redistributables themselves, asks
them to run a firmware update (which seems unnecessary on recently shipped
models), and then use a program that doesn't even remember basic language
settings between launches.

Safe to say I have a few issues with the program, and that's before mentioning
that it is entirely useless on Linux. Run through Wine it will fail entirely to
detect and work with a plugged in device.
